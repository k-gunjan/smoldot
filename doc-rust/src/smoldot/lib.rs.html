//!
//! # Overview of a blockchain
//!
//! A blockchain is, in its essence, a distributed and decentralized key-value database. The
//! principle of a blockchain is to make it possible for any participant to perform modifications
//! to this database, and for all participants to eventually agree on the current state of said
//! database.
//!
//! In Polkadot and Substrate-compatible chains, the state of this database is referred to as
//! &quot;the storage&quot;. The storage can be seen more or less as a very large `HashMap`.
//!
//! A blockchain therefore consists in three main things:
//!
//! - The initial state of the storage at the moment when the blockchain starts.
//! - A list of blocks, where each block represents a group of modifications performed to the
//! storage.
//! - A peer-to-peer network of clients connected to each other and exchanging information such
//! as newly-produced blocks.
//!
//! Blocks are built on top of each other, forming a sequential list of modifications to the
//! storage on top of its initial state.
//!
//! ## Blocks
//!
//! A block primarily consists in three properties:
//!
//! - A parent block, referred to by its hash.
//! - An ordered list of **extrinsics**, representing a state change about the storage. An
//! extrinsic can be either a **transaction** or an **intrinsic**.
//! - A list of **digest log items**, which include information necessary to verify the
//! authenticity of the block, such as a cryptographic signature of the block made by its author.
//!
//! In order to make abstractions easier, there also exists what is called the **genesis block**,
//! or block number 0. It doesn&#39;t have any parent, extrinsic, or digest item.
//!
//! From these three block properties, the following other properties can be derived:
//!
//! - The **hash** of the block. This is a unique 32 bytes identifier obtained by hashing all the
//! block&#39;s information together in a specific way.
//! - The **block number**. It is equal to the parent&#39;s block number plus one, or equal to zero
//! for the genesis block
//! - The state of the storage. It consists in the state of the storage of the parent block, on
//! top of which the block&#39;s extrinsics have been applied. The state of the storage of the genesis
//! block is the initial state.
//!
//! &gt; **Note**: Not all these properties are held in memory or even on disk. For instance, the
//! &gt;           state of the storage is quite large and holding a full version of the storage of
//! &gt;           every single block in the chain would be unrealistic.
//!
//! ## Trie
//!
//! The **trie** is a data structure that plays an important role in the way a blockchain
//! functions.
//!
//! It consists in a tree of nodes associated with a key, some of these nodes containing a value.
//! Each node is associated with a hash called the **Merkle value** that encompasses the Merkle
//! values of the node&#39;s children. The Merkle value of the root node of the tree is designated
//! as &quot;the Merkle trie root&quot; or &quot;the trie root&quot;.
//!
//! See the [`trie`] module for more details.
//!
//! ## Block headers
//!
//! In practical terms, when a block needs to be stored or transferred between machines, it
//! is split in two parts: a **header** and a **body**. The body of a block simply consists in its
//! list of extrinsics.
//!
//! &gt; **Note**: The body of a block and the list of extrinsics of a block are the exact same
//! &gt;           thing, and these two designations can be used interchangeably.
//!
//! A block&#39;s header contains the following:
//!
//! - The hash of the parent of the block.
//! - The block number.
//! - The **state trie root**, which consists in the trie root of all the keys and values of the
//! storage of this block.
//! - The **extrinsics trie root**, which consists in the Merkle root of a trie containing the
//! extrinsics of the block.
//! - The list of digest log items.
//!
//! The hash of a block consists in the `blake2` hash of its header.
//!
//! See the [`header`] module for more information.
//!
//! ## Runtime
//!
//! The state of the storage of each block is mostly opaque from the client&#39;s perspective. There
//! exists, however, a few hard coded keys, the most important one being
//! `[0x3a, 0x63, 0x6f, 0x64, 0x65]` (which is the ASCII encoding of the string `:code`). The
//! value associated with this key must always be a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) binary
//! code called the **runtime**.
//!
//! This WebAssembly binary code must obey a certain ABI and is responsible for the following
//! actions:
//!
//! - Verifying whether a block has been correctly created by its author.
//! - Providing the list of modifications to the storage performed by a block, given its header
//! and body.
//! - Generating the header of newly-created blocks.
//! - Validating transactions received from third-parties, in order to later be potentially
//! included in a block.
//! - Providing the tools necessary to create transactions.
//!
//! In other words, the runtime is responsible for all the actual *logic* behind the chain being
//! run. For instance, when performing a transfer of tokens between one account and another, it is
//! the runtime WebAssembly code that verifies that the balances are correct and updates them.
//!
//! Since applying an extrinsic modifies the state of the storage, it is possible for an
//! extrinsic to modify this WebAssembly binary code. This is called a **runtime upgrade**. In
//! other words, any block can potentially modify the logic of the chain.
//!
//! See also the [`executor`] module for more information.
//!
//! ## Forks and finalization
//!
//! While blocks are built on top of each other, they don&#39;t necessarily form one single chain. It
//! is possible for multiple different blocks to have the same parent, thereby forming multiple
//! chains. This is called a **fork**.
//!
//! When multiple chains fly around in the network, each node select one chain they consider as
//! the &quot;best&quot;. However, because of latency, disconnects, or similar reasons, it is possible for
//! a node to not be immediately aware of the existence of a chain that it would consider as a
//! better chain than its current best. Later, when this node learns about this better chain, it
//! will need to perform a **reorg** (short for *reorganization*), where blocks that were part of
//! the best chain no longer are.
//!
//! In order to avoid troublesome situations arising from reorgs, Substrate/Polkadot provides the
//! concept of **finality**. Once a block has been finalized, it is guaranteed to always be part
//! of the best chain. By extension, the parent of a finalized block is always finalized as well.
//! The genesis block of a chain is by definition is always finalized.
//!
//! As such, a chain of blocks is composed of two parts: one **finalized** part (usually the
//! longest), and one non-finalized part. While the finalized part is a single linear list of
//! blocks, the non-finalized part consists in a *directed rooted tree*.
//!
//! In order to finalize a block, Substrate/Polkadot nodes use the **GrandPa** algorithm. Nodes
//! that are authorized to do so by the runtime emit votes on the peer-to-peer network. When two
//! thirds or more of the authorized nodes have voted for a specific block to be finalized, it
//! effectively becomes finalized.
//!
//! After these votes have been collected, they are collected in what is called a
//! **justification**. This justification can later be requested by nodes who might not have
//! received all the votes, or for example if they were offline.
//!
//! See the [`chain`] and [`finality`] modules for more information.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This library intentionally doesn&#39;t provide any ready-to-use blockchain client. Instead, it
//! provides tools that can be combined together in order to create a client.
//!
//! Components that are most certainly needed are:
//!
//! - Connectivity to a peer-to-peer network. See the [`network`] module.
//! - A persistent storage for the blocks. See the [`database`] module.
//! - A state machine that holds information about the state of the chain and verifies the
//! authenticity and/or correctness of blocks received from the network. See the [`sync`]
//! module.
//!
//! Optionally:
//!
//! - The capacity to author new blocks. This isn&#39;t implemented as of the writing of this
//! documentation.
//! - A JSON-RPC client, in order to put a convenient-to-use UI on top of the client. See the
//! [`json_rpc`] module.
//! - TODO: telemetry
//!
